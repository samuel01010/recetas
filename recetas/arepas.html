    <h1>Recipe to make arepas</h1> 
<h4>Arepas are a traditional food in some Latin American countries
    , where corn is a primary ingredient in the basic diet.
     This dough, made from corn flour, is usually cooked on a
      large griddle and is usually prepared to cook batches of
       more than one arepa. Venezuelan arepas stand out from
        other varieties because their dough is thicker,
         which allows them to be filled with a wide variety of
          fillings. Although they are usually eaten for breakfast
           and their preparation is very simple, do not underestimate
            them: arepas can be eaten at any time of the day and,
             with a sufficiently powerful filling, they can also
              serve as lunch.</h4>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
 <li><h4>precooked corn flour</h4></li> 
 <li><h4>water</h4></li>
 <li><h4>salt</h4></li> 
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h4>Pour the water into a bowl, add the teaspoon of salt
         and dissolve it. Add the pre-cooked corn flour little by
          little. Once you have added it all, knead until you form
           a homogeneous dough.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Keep kneading until it is completely integrated. Let
         it rest for about 5 minutes and resume kneading. If, after
          letting it rest, the dough is very liquid or very dry, add
           more flour or water respectively.</h4></li>
         <li><h4>Form medium balls with the dough, with this
             recipe you will make about 8 arepas. Begin to flatten
              them with your palms to make the traditional arepa shape.
               They should be at least 1 centimeter thick.</h4></li>
         <li><h4>Place a teaspoon of oil on a griddle and spread
             it over the entire surface with the help of kitchen
              paper. Heat and grill the arepas. Cook over low heat
               until you see that they have hardened on one side.
                Then, turn them over and let them brown on the other
                 side.</h4></li>
            </ol>
