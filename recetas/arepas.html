    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Arepas are a traditional food in some Latin American countries , where
      corn is a primary ingredient in the basic diet. This dough, made from corn
      flour, is usually cooked on a large griddle and is usually prepared to
      cook batches of more than one arepa. Venezuelan arepas stand out from
      other varieties because their dough is thicker, which allows them to be
      filled with a wide variety of fillings. Although they are usually eaten
      for breakfast and their preparation is very simple, do not underestimate
      them: arepas can be eaten at any time of the day and, with a sufficiently
      powerful filling, they can also serve as lunch.

      <li>
        
          Pour the water into a bowl, add the teaspoon of salt and dissolve it.
          Add the pre-cooked corn flour little by little. Once you have added it
          all, knead until you form a homogeneous dough.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        
          Keep kneading until it is completely integrated. Let it rest for about
          5 minutes and resume kneading. If, after letting it rest, the dough is
          very liquid or very dry, add more flour or water respectively.
        
      </li>
      <li>
          Form medium balls with the dough, with this recipe you will make about
          8 arepas. Begin to flatten them with your palms to make the
          traditional arepa shape. They should be at least 1 centimeter thick.</li>
      <li>Place a teaspoon of oil on a griddle and spread it over the entire
          surface with the help of kitchen paper. Heat and grill the arepas.
          Cook over low heat until you see that they have hardened on one side.
          Then, turn them over and let them brown on the other side.</li>
    </ol>
