    <h1>Recipe to make cachapas</h1> 
<h4>Venezuelan cachapas are the first cousins of arepas and
     although they are quite similar, there are substantial
      differences in the way they are made.

    Arepas are a dough that only requires pre-cooked corn flour,
     water and salt, while cachapas also contain cooked sweet
      corn kernels and are juicier.</h4>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
 <li><h4>sweet corn</h4></li> 
 <li><h4>Medium egg for the dough</h4></li>
 <li><h4>milk</h4></li> 
 <li><h4>precooked corn flour</h4></li> 
 <li><h4>butter</h4></li>
 <li><h4>guayanes cheese</h4></li> 

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h4>In a food processor or blender glass, mix the milk, egg and cooked sweet corn and blend well until you obtain a dough that is as smooth as possible.
    </h4></li>
    <li><h4>Add the flour and butter and blend until completely integrated and then rest the dough in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for approximately half an hour.
    </h4></li>
    <li><h4>After that time, heat a frying pan over medium heat with a little butter. When it melts, add a ladle of the dough to fill the pan.
    </h4></li>
    <li><h4>We cook it over medium heat until bubbles appear and it completely separates from the pan. With the help of a spatula we turn it over.
    </h4></li>
