    <p>
      Venezuelan cachapas are the first cousins of arepas and although they are
      quite similar, there are substantial differences in the way they are made.
      Arepas are a dough that only requires pre-cooked corn flour, water and
      salt, while cachapas also contain cooked sweet corn kernels and are
      juicier.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>sweet corn</li>
      <li>Medium egg for the dough</li>
      <li>milk</li>
      <li>precooked corn flour</li>
      <li>butter</li>
      <li>guayanes cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a food processor or blender glass, mix the milk, egg and cooked
          sweet corn and blend well until you obtain a dough that is as smooth
          as possible.</li>
      <li>Add the flour and butter and blend until completely integrated and
          then rest the dough in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for
          approximately half an hour.</li>
      <li>After that time, heat a frying pan over medium heat with a little
          butter. When it melts, add a ladle of the dough to fill the pan.</li>
      <li>We cook it over medium heat until bubbles appear and it completely
          separates from the pan. With the help of a spatula we turn it over.
        </li>
    </ol>
