    <p>
      Venezuelan empanadas are crescent-shaped pastries, they are made from corn
      flour - which makes them distinctive from other types of empanadas - and
      any type of filling that can withstand frying. Not to mention that they
      are gluten-free empanadas, so they are appropriate for this type of
      intolerance.
