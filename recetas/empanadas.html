    <h1>Recipe to make empanadas</h1> 
<h4>Venezuelan empanadas are crescent-shaped pastries, they are 
    made from corn flour - which makes them distinctive from other
     types of empanadas - and any type of filling that can
      withstand frying. Not to mention that they are gluten-free
       empanadas, so they are appropriate for this type of 
       intolerance.
